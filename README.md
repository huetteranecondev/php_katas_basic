# Basic Skeleton for PHP Coding Kata - String Calculator

## Installation
Run "composer install" on the command line in the project base directory

## Test Execution
Run "./vendor/bin/phpunit test" on the command line in the project base directory

## The Kata
### General
Please make sure you don't plan ahead for this Kata and implement one requirement after the other, 
as if they would result from different user stories arising over the year.

### Techniques
Use ping-pong pair programming and test-driven development to implement the Kata.

### Instructions
The instructions for the Kata can be found here:
https://github.com/xpeppers/string-calculator-kata

### Bonus Requirements
Don't produce methods with a length of more than 5 lines. 
This shall help practicing to find meaningful method names.
Note: This step shall only be done as an additional refactoring step if there is some time left ;-)
